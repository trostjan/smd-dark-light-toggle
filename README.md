## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Toggle color theme to their preference

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://trostjan.github.io/smd-dark-light-toggle/]

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Scss
- javaScript

### What I learned

Using media query prefered-color-scheme to check for user's OS prefered color scheme and change the light/dark mode theme based on that.
Using javascript to manipulate local storage.
Overall I had no problems creating layout, but I had to make a good research through different sources to correctly implement the light/dark toggle.
